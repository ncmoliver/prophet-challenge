## ü™ú The Program's Analysis Process
| Step | Description | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| **Step 1 -- Find "Unusual Patterns In Hourly Google Search Traffic"** | **1.** Using Google search trends data on the company, the first step involved reading the data into a dataframe and slicing out the month the company released its quarterly financial results, which was in May 2020. --- **2.** Calculate May's total search traffic and compare it to the monthly median across all months and combine the search traffic trends and the stock data into one dataframe. (screenshot #1)  |
| **Step 2 -- Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality** | This step resulted in three line graphs showing the hourly search data by time of day (24 hours), day of week (Monday to Sunday), and by the week of the year (Week 1 to Week 52). (Screenshot 2 - 4) |
| **Step 3 -- Relate Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns** | **1.** In this step we first investigated the stock data and determined there was a shock in the beginning of year followed by increased revenues. **2.** Added new columns to the joint dataframe. |
| **Step 3a -- Lagged Search Trends** | Displays a one-hour lag in the search trends,  |
| **Step 3b -- Stock Volatility** | Displays the variation of the company's closing trading stock prices |
| **Step 3 -- Hourly Stock Return** | Shows how much the stock has gone up or down in one hour. |
| **Step 4 -- Review & Analyze Correlation**| Created a time series model and plotted forecast.  This step involved setting up the data for a Prophet forcasting model, using the model to make predictions, and plotting the forecast. (screenshot ) |

### üîç Future Interest (based on..)

**Time Of Day with Greatest Popularity**    
Check the sales data in the regions where the company sells products to see if boosting search trends can increase profits.    

**Day Of Week With Most Search Traffic?**    
Understand what is happening on Tuesdays throughout the year to attract more attention than all other days. What measures and strategies can we implement on Tuesdays to increase revenue.    

**Lowest Point for Search Traffic In Calendar Year?**    
It would be beneficial to closely examine the month of October to find more indicators associated with the drop in search traffic for that period.
